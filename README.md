# Borderlands-The-Pre-Sequel-Story-Mode-Save-Xbox-
An easy playthrough character for those wanting to mainly experience the story of Borderlands solo, without too much trouble.

SKIP TO END FOR INSTRUCTIONS

This works on a regular and legit Xbox 360 console (not modded) and I can still play coop online with these save files.
 
I have made this save mostly for my own use because I am Not the most epic FPS player, I find it hard to find other players on Xbox 360 to tackle the big fights, Boss fights and Raids are impossible for me solo at the right level, I love the story and want to experience the whole game without it being too hard or stressful. Borderlands The Pre Sequel (and BL2) have epic story lines and are really hard to experience on your own with a regular playthrough - it takes a lot of time, effort and stress to do this solo (but it is more rewarding I know) but with this build you can fly through it and focus on one of the most awesome storylines EVER.

This save pretty much makes you untouchable to enemies (not completely though) and the high level gear gives you 1 shot kill on most things, towards the end of the story it will take a few more bullets though (just a few though I assure you) - I used this save to complete the game (Base game), raid, secret boss, and normal bosses solo with no trouble at all.

What you get:
* Claptrap character at level 50 (Why claptrap? Because he is immune to zero oxygen environments, the emphasis here was to make it easy to play)
* 4 Awesome level 50 guns: Assault rifle, Laser Weapon, SMG and Shotgun (Only 4 because I wanted to keep inventory space so you can still hold mission items and pick up gear - If you want other guns or maxed out 2000+ gun saves I have a save for that too - I found it awkward with an inventory showing 2000/15. These guns will easily get you through the entire playthrough)
* Awesome gear, homing shock grenade mod, Corrosive shield that makes Clap immune to corrosion (he is most damaged by corrosion), and with this shield, if enemies melee you they die from corrosion)
* Money - 1,999,999
* Moonstones - 400
* Some customization items in the Concordia Bank

I RECCOMMEND:
* Your game will start at the very beginning with a level 50 claptrap - you will need to equip your gear from your inventory.
* Focus mainly on the main story quests first - that way when you get to the end boss and raid you will be level 50 while they should be at only around level 27ish, then go and do all the side quests - you can accept them just focus on completing the main story first.
* Get to Concordia as soon as possible, see the Black Market vendor and use the moonstones to increase back-pack space, and also increase ammo amounts for the gun types you have.
* On the final raid use the electric homing grenade, and electric gun I have provided - you have to stand in front of him and shoot him in the face - Electricity is the key and I have done it with the loadout I am giving you

What I have done here is take a save I found online and customize it for Story mode playthrough (the person had 2000/15 inventory meaning you cant pick anything up unless you drop like 1986 items first, plus it kept buggin out where the inventory was overfull). I picked out a few awesome items and stripped it down so you can experience the game properly and still collect items if you want to.
If you want this save with different guns let me know as I have access to literally thousands of items so can pick what you want, I can even use the save editor to create custom ones. If you want the same save but the original one I mentioned with the 2000+ guns and mods you can find it on this Github account.

Let me know if this was useful and I might make some more, I know 360's are oldschool now but i love jumping back onto mine now and then to play these games - I havent tried uploading these saves to the cloud and transferring to XB1 yet, I am interested to know if this works though.

Enjoy :)


INSTRUCTIONS - HOW TO USE: (my recommendations)
It is easier to swap a save file then create a new one, so please follow carefully for this to work properly:
In short what you need to do is, make a new cklaptrap character in the game, save it, copy your save opnto a USB, load it up with PC software, replace the claptrap save information file for this new one. Horizon is a program that can read Xbox 360 data from a USB, and do a few other things with it, without this program you won't be able to access your saves on the PC.

WHAT YOU WILL NEED:
* USB stick to put your save on
* A PC or laptop
* Horizon Xbox 360 Save Editor tool: https://www.wemod.com/horizon/
* The save file from this repository (CL4P_STORY.sav) if it is a .zip fil, extract it

HOW TO:
* You need a configured USB for your Xbox (to put the save files onto and swap between PC and Xbox). Insert a blank USB over 1GB to your Xbox 360, go to storage devices, select it and format it for use on the Xbox.
* Load up Borderlands the Pre Sequel and select this new USB device as the storage device, it wont interfere with your existing saves this way.
* Create a new Claptrap character (we are going to swap the save data from this file)
* Get through the opening intro and cutscenes, then select Save and Quit as soon as you are able to.
* The save is now on the USB so shut everything down and remove the USB.
* Load up your PC and download Horizon (https://www.wemod.com/horizon/).
* Install Horizon using the set-up file you downloaded (you may have to also go online and register a free account with Horizon, using an email address before you can use it for this, but I am not 100% sure if this is a requirement)
* Right click Horizon icon and select "Run as Admin" - this is very important to get it to read the hidden Xbox save data.
* If all is good it will have read your USB automatically - In horizon device explorer you will see your Xbox USB data, go to games, then Borderlands TPS, find your Claptrap level one save you made earlier in the list (DONT use the backup save file if one is in there)
* Drag this level one claptrap save over to the main grey area in horizon - a window will open with the inforation inside.
* Click the small contents tab, you should see a filetree showing a file called something like GameSave.sav
* Right click it, and select REPLACE, then select this save file from your PC, and also make sure you select the XBOX 360 filetype in the little frop down menu, otherwise it will give you an error
* You should see a success message 
* Click the red menu tab saying "Save Hash and Reassign" this is very important to get it to read on your profile.
* You can now put the USB back in the console, turn it on, load up the game, select the USB as storage device, and see your level 50  character ready to go :)
